## Clarification Questions

### User Management
1. **User ID Format**: What format should the unique user ID follow? (e.g., alphanumeric, minimum/maximum length, special characters allowed?)
[Answer]: alphanumeric
2. **User ID Persistence**: Should the user ID be remembered across browser sessions, or does the user need to enter it each time?

[Answer]: no duplicates
### Quiz Topics and Questions
4. **Topic Management**: Who will manage the quiz topics? Should there be an admin interface to add/remove topics?
[Answer]: administrator. For phase 1 we will enter static data through scripts
5. **Question Bank Size**: How many questions should be available per topic to ensure variety?
[Answer]: 100
6. **Question Difficulty**: Should questions have difficulty levels, or are all questions treated equally?
[Answer]: no difficulty level, all questions are considered same level.
7. **Question Format**: Are all questions text-based, or should we support images/multimedia?
[Answer]: text based for phase 1

### Quiz Mechanics

### Scoring and Dashboard
11. **Score Calculation**: Is it simply 1 point per correct answer (max 10 points per quiz)?
[Answer]: yes
12. **Dashboard Data**: Should the dashboard show additional metrics like time taken, topic performance, etc.?
[Answer]: topic performance, average time to answer
13. **Data Persistence**: How long should quiz history be stored? Should there be a limit?
[Answer]: store average scores for all quizzes. Actual scores only of the last 5 quizzes. for ever

### Technical Considerations
14. **Platform**: Should this be a web application, mobile app, or both?
[Answer]: web application responsive
15. **Offline Capability**: Should the quiz work offline once loaded?
[Answer]: online only
16. **Data Storage**: Should data be stored locally (browser storage) or require a backend database?
[Answer]: backend database
17. **Question Randomization**: Should the order of answer choices also be randomized?
[Answer]: yes

### User Experience
18. **Accessibility**: What accessibility standards should be met (WCAG compliance level)?
[Answer]: none
19. **Responsive Design**: What screen sizes/devices should be supported?
[Answer]:laptops and mobiles
20. **Feedback**: Should users see correct answers after completing a quiz?
[Answer]: yes

## Next Steps
1. **Review this plan** and provide feedback on the structure and clarification questions
2. **Answer clarification questions** or indicate which ones can be decided during implementation
3. **Approve the plan** to proceed with requirements documentation
4. **Proceed with implementation** once plan is approved

## Notes
- This plan focuses on creating comprehensive requirements while maintaining minimal complexity
- Critical decisions requiring stakeholder input are clearly identified
- The plan ensures all aspects of the quiz application are considered before implementation begins
